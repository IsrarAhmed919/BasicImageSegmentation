# Image Segmentation Using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates image segmentation, a technique for assigning a label to every pixel in an image. It's particularly useful for identifying objects and boundaries within images.

## Dataset

 Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset:
     37 pet breeds with 200 images per breed
     Includes images, corresponding segmentation masks, and labels for species and breed
     Downloadable via TensorFlow Datasets

## Dependencies

 TensorFlow
 TensorFlow Datasets
 matplotlib

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets matplotlib
   ```
2. Install additional example code for the decoder (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/tensorflow/examples.git
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook `image_segmentation.ipynb` to execute the code.

## Key Files

 `image_segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code
 `helper_functions.py`: Helper functions for visualization and data loading

## Project Structure

## Model Architecture

 U-Net-like architecture:
     Downsampling path for feature extraction (using MobileNetV2 pre-trained on ImageNet)
     Upsampling path for generating segmentation masks
     Skip connections between corresponding layers in the downsampling and upsampling paths

## Training

 Adam optimizer
 Dice loss (specifically designed for segmentation tasks)

## Evaluation

 Visual comparison of predicted masks with ground truth masks
 Dice coefficient (measures overlap between predicted and ground truth masks)

## Future Work

 Experiment with different model architectures
 Explore other loss functions
 Apply the model to different segmentation tasks
